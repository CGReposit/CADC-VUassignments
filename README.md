This repository contains a collection of R Markdown files that showcase a progression of data-analysis and natural-language-processing workflows in R. The materials cover foundational data wrangling and visualization, exploratory analysis of textual data, dictionary-based approaches for extracting linguistic features, and supervised machine-learning techniques for classifying text. 

Together, these documents illustrate a full analytical pipeline. From preparing and understanding structured and unstructured data, to modelling, evaluating, and interpreting results in a reproducible and well-documented format.
